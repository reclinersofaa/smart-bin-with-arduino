A smart dustbin that segregares waste based on dry and wet waste with the help of parameters like moisture and distance. This is a collaborative project for our MPCA subject in sem4. 

Built using Ardiuno with a manually assembled circuit connected to a DIY flap dustbin. The flap is connected to a servo motor that moves the flap after the readings from the ultrasonic sensor and the soil humidity sensor for the moisture level have been processed. 

The Arduino chip we had used was the CH340, for which the driver isn't preinstalled in most systems. Driver link: https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html
